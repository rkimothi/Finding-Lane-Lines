# **Finding Lane Lines on the Road**

When we drive, we use our eyes to decide where to go.  The lines on the road that show us where the lanes are act as our constant reference for where to steer the vehicle.  Naturally, one of the first things we would like to do in developing a self-driving car is to automatically detect lane lines using an algorithm.

In this project I have detected lane lines in images using Python and OpenCV. I have not used any Machine Learning technique for this project but just some image processing techniques.

Here is a link to the final video output that was generated using the jupyter notebook:
